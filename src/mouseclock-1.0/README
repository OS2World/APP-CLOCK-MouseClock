Mouseclock -- a little program to display the current time using the X
root cursor.

This program is under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

How to read the doc ? ;)
# xmkmf (if you don't use gcc and don't keep X includes & lib in /usr/X11)
# make
# ./mouseclock -h

Suggestion of options, to get a big, friendly mouse pointer :
mouseclock -fn -*-lucida-bold-i-*-*-18-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -fg \#ffa0a0 -bd 2

	Please note that some X servers may restrict the maximum size
of the pointer, because they are using hardware sprites (lutins
materiels.) On XFree86 3.1.2 & Cirrus Logic video card, adding an
'Option "sw_cursor"' to the XF86Config will force the use of a
software sprite. I don't know for other configurations.

This program was tested under
- linux v1.3/XFree86 v3
- SunOS 4.1.4/X11R4
with gcc, and should probably compile ok on any reasonable platform.

I took the NameToXColor function from "xancur", a program by
Christopher Alexander North-Keys <erlkonig@gnu.ai.mit.edu>, and maybe
some other bits (I really don't remember. Maybe the cmdline options
handling ?)
